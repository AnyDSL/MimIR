# Comparison

## TODO

- [x] pow with boilerplate
- [ ] power with fast exponentiation
- [ ] ad in haskell vergleich
- [ ] enzyme with haskell (?)
- [ ] test thorin with less optimizations
  - [ ] only inlining


## Goal

- Find out minimal set of optimizations to get rid of boilerplate
- How much does thorin help
- Compiler approach (low level -- with thorin also high level) vs inline approach/overloading (no optimization, high level)
