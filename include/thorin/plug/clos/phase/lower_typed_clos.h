/// This pass lowers *typed closures* to *untyped closures*.
/// For details on typed closures, see ClosConv.
/// In general, untyped closure have the form `(pointer-to-environment, code)` with the following exceptions:
/// * Lam%s in callee-position should be λ-lifted and thus don't receive an environment.
/// * External and imported (not set) Lam%s also don't receive an environment.
///   They are appropriately η-wrapped by ClosConv.
/// * If the environment is of integer type, it's directly stored in the environment-pointer ("unboxed").
///   @note In theory this should work for other primitive types as well, but the LL backend does not handle the
///   required conversion correctly.
///
/// Further, first class continuations are rewritten to returning functions.
/// They receive `⊥` as a dummy continuation.
/// Therefore Clos2SJLJ should have taken place prior to this pass.
///
/// This pass will heap-allocate ClosKind::esc closures and stack-allocate everything else.
/// These annotations are introduced by LowerTypedClosPrep.
