/// Example: `Cn[ [mem,  A, B], C  , ret]`
/// Arg    : `Cn[ [mem, [A, B , C]], ret]` (general `Cn[ [mem, args], ret]`)
/// Flat   : `Cn[  mem,  A, B , C  , ret]` (general `Cn[mem, ...args, ret]`)
/// For convenience, we want Arg-style for optimizations.
/// The invariant is that every closed function has at most one "real" argument and a return-continuation.
/// If memory is present, the argument is a pair of memory and the remaining arguments.
/// However, flat style is required for code generation. Especially in the closure conversion.
///
/// The concept is to rewrite all signatures of functions with consistent reassociation of arguments.
/// This change is propagated to (nested) applications.
