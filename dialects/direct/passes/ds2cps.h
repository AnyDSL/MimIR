/// `f: Î  a : A -> B`
/// `f_cps : cn[a:A, cn B]`
/// Only the type signature of the function is changed and the body is wrapped in the newly added return continuation.
/// (Technical detail: the arguments are substituted to fit the new function)
///
/// In a second distinct but connected step, the call sites are converted:
/// For a direct style call `f args`, the call to the cps function `cps2ds_dep ... f_cps args` is introduced.
/// The underlying substitution is `f` -> `cps2ds_dep ... f_cps`.
